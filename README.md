# PomodoroTimer
Using Tkinter and Python i made a simple app with timer depending on Pomodoro Teqnique. It simply has 2 buttons START and RESET and does 
everything it suppose to do. After working for 25min the title changes and timer resets for 5min break. After repeating this process for 4 times
then break time increases to 15min. It also has reps counter at the bottom with the mark emoji.
